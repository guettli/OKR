# OKR

From Wikipedia:

> Objectives and key results (OKR) is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.
> 
> The development of OKRs is generally attributed to Andy Grove the "Father of OKRs", who introduced the approach to Intel during his tenure there and documented this in his 1983 book High Output Management. Grove's simple but effective concept is explained by John Doerr: "The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it".

> OKRs comprise an objective—a clearly defined goal—and 3–5 key results—specific measures used to track the achievement of that goal. The goal of OKR is to define how to achieve objectives through concrete, specific and measurable actions. Key results can be measured on a 0–100% scale or any numerical unit (e.g. dollar amount, %, items, etc.). Objectives should also be supported by initiatives, which are the plans and activities that help to achieve the objective and move forward the key results. It is recommended that your target success rate for key results be 70%. A 70% success rate encourages competitive goal making that is meant to stretch workers at low risk. If 100% of the key results are consistently being met, key results should be reevaluated.

There are several articles and books about OKR, in this text I will focus on my opinionated personal point of view.

## Scrum (two weeks), OKR (quarterly)

There are several loops/cycles in daily work.

For example a software developer has this tiny loop: Edit code, execute the tests, check the result, then again edit code, execute tests ...

If you are using Scrum, then you have the sprint cycle, which usualy is two weeks long.

Most companies stopped to have long "waterfall" cycles which last years, but nevertheless something is missing if you only plan for two weeks.

I think quartely OKR fit very well, if you do Scrum. This gives the development team enough freedom, but nevertheless you focus on a higher goal.

## OKR vs WOOP

For personal goal setting, I prefer WOOP, since it is more. It is "mental contrasting" which helps to be prepared, since it 
contains the steps "obstacles and plans".

## From Key-results to Objective

Usualy you write down the objective, and then create key results.

Sometimes this is easy. For example a development team wants to improve the page navigation and they already have a clear vision. They have a clear plan and the key results are like the small step to get them to their big goal. 

Sometimes it is hard to find an objective. Your head is full of many small steps. For example a DevOp team has no vision: the servers are running fine and no big changes are planed. Then just try it the other way round: First write down
your key results and then group them to objectives.
